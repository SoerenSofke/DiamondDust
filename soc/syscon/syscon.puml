[SYSCON] #--> CLK_O
[SYSCON] #--> RST_O

note left of CLK_O
    The system clock output [CLK_O] is
    generated by the SYSCON module. It
    coordinates all activities for the
    internal logic within the WISHBONE
    interconnect.
end note

note right of RST_O
    The reset output [RST_O] is generated
    by the SYSCON module. It forces all
    WISHBONE interfaces to restart. All
    internal self-starting state machines
    are forced into an initial state.
end note


note right of [SYSCON]
    A WISHBONE module that drives the system
    clock [CLK_O] and reset [RST_O] signals.
end note
